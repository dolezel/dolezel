### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently working as Senior Software Engineer at Microsoft in a team taking care of keeping memory consumption of Teams in limits.

But besides that I also maintain(ed) or contribute(d) to some opensource repos:

* https://github.com/salsita/node-pg-migrate
* https://github.com/dolezel/react-csv-downloader
* https://github.com/frontend-collective/react-sortable-tree
* https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui
* https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped

and more...

Also I had few talks about JS, Node or React at my previous employer - [Salsita](https://www.salsitasoft.com/):

* https://github.com/dolezel/bb-node-performance
* https://github.com/dolezel/bb-rxjs-react
* https://github.com/dolezel/bb-demo
